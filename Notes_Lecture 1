Python advantages\n","- works on different computing platforms\n","- simple syntax similar to English language\n","- runs on an interpreter system\n","- procedural, object-oriented, functional way\n","\n","5. Python VS other Programming Languages\n","- high readability\n","- new lines to complete a command\n","- identation, using whitespace to define scope\n","\n","6. Type of Programming Language that Pythons belongs to:\n","- interpreted language\n","- both a complied and interpreted language (compliation part is hidden)\n","\n","7. Advantages of Interpreted Language\n","- the ease of debugging increases\n","- less size\n","- generate byte code before interpretation, byte code can be used by other platform\n","\n","8. Disadvantages of Interpreted Language\n","- slower becuase of interpretation\n","- makes the execution time high"],"metadata":{"id":"aZ98IteDjQ1k"}}]}
